### About The Final Project
![Flight Path Map](/output.png)

For our CS225 Final Project, we chose the OpenFlights Dataset to complete from our given dataset options. Our objective was to calculate the shortest distance between two airports. We completed this by implementing Dijkstra's function which finds the shortest possible distance given with two given airport locations, given there is a path. All of the possible path are shown in the world map image above. Another algorithm used is the Breadth-First Search, or BFS, which allows us to figure out if we are able to travel between the two airports given.



### Data Used
https://openflights.org/data.html



### Installation
1. Clone the repo
`https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/cs225-fa20/iia2-ericjin2-isaact2-pranshu3.git`

2. Fetch code
`git fetch relese`
`git merge release/FILE_NAME -m "Merging release repository"`

3. Make and compile code
`make; make test`

4. Test code
`./test`



### Usage
When complied and run, this code is used to calculate which paths an airplane can take from one airport to another. When given the specific starting point and ending point, the code will determine if there is a path connecting to those two airport locations and it will find the shortest path to those airports. It does this by calculating the distance from the starting airport to the next, searching for the shortest path and checking every possible path to print the shortest path.



### Contributing
In editing and completing the code, we use a series of git function to successfully add and push the files in the GitHub repository.

* `git add -u`
* `git commit -m "REPLACE THIS WITH MESSAGE OF CHANGES MADE"`
* `git push origin master`
